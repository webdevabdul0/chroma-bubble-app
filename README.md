## ðŸš€ Features

- **OpenAI ChatGPT-4.5 (gpt-4o)** â€“ Harnesses the power of the latest OpenAI model for fast and intelligent chat responses.
- **TypeScript & Cursor-Powered Development** â€“ Developed using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh/) with TypeScript for maintainable and robust code.
- **PDF Upload with Smart Q&A** â€“ Upload any PDF and instantly query its content using natural language.
- **Automated n8n Integration** â€“ Triggers a backend n8n workflow that:
  - Extracts text from the uploaded PDF
  - Generates semantic embeddings using OpenAIâ€™s `text-embedding-3-small` model
  - Uploads the embeddings to a **Pinecone** vector database
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** â€“ User queries are enriched with context retrieved from the PDF embeddings in Pinecone, providing accurate, document-aware answers.
